# Responsive Breakpoints

For this project, we are going to be developing the stylesheets mobile-first. This means that our breakpoints will assume that by default, we are styling for our smallest viewport sizes. We will then begin to amend styles as our viewport sizes get larger.

Here are the breakpoints that we will be using:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Breakpoint</th>
      <th>Class infix</th>
      <th>Dimensions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Extra Small</td>
      <td>xs</td>
      <td>&lt; 576px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Small</td>
      <td>s</td>
      <td>&gt;= 576px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Medium</td>
      <td>m</td>
      <td>&gt;= 768px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Large</td>
      <td>l</td>
      <td>&gt;= 992px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Extra Large</td>
      <td>xl</td>
      <td>&gt;= 1200px</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
