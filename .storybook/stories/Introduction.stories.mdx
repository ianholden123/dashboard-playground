# Storybook - Dashboard Playground

This is the Storybook component library for the [Dashboard Playground](https://github.com/ianholden123/dashboard-playground) project by [Ian Holden](https://ianholden.co.uk).

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

## Structure

### UI Components

I have decided to follow the [Atomic Design pattern](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) when creating my project's components:

#### Atoms

Here, you can find the many components that make up the building blocks for our frontend. Components should be built atomically and should not be affected by an external component.

#### Organisms

Here, you can find the larger components that are built from multiple atom components. This is helpful when we want to see how different atom components interact with each other or provide additional markup around an atom component.

#### Molecules

Here, we combine many organisms to make up a section of our template.

#### Templates

Here, you can find layouts that combine multiple molecules, organisms and atoms to produce the outline of a page. Full interaction is not complete yet but we should start to see the beginning of a page.

#### Pages

Here, you can find functional versions of our templates. These should feel most familiar with something that you will see on a website/app.

### Styles

Here, you can find the style guides that will affect the entire application. You can find information about the project's [colours](?path=/story/styles-colours--page) and [responsive breakpoints](?path=/story/styles-responsive-breakpoints--page).
