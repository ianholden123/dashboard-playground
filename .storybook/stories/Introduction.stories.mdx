# Storybook - Dashboard Playground

This is the Storybook component library for the [Dashboard Playground](https://github.com/ianholden123/dashboard-playground) project by [Ian Holden](https://ianholden.co.uk).

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

## Structure

If you have the sidebar open, you should see a list of options. This sidebar captures all of the different aspects of my component library for this project. I have decided to structure this Storybook area using this structure:


### Components - Atoms

Here, you can find the many components that make up the building blocks for our frontend. Components should be built atomically and should not be affected by an external component. The idea of [atoms](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#atoms) was formed by Brad Frost.

### Components - Organisms

Here, you can find the larger components that are built from our atom components. They help us build the larger sections of our frontend. The idea of [organisms](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#organisms) was formed by Brad Frost.

### Pages

Here, you can find layouts that combine multiple components to produce fully functioning pages.

### Styles

Here, you can find the style guides that will be affect the entire application. You can find information about the project's **colour scheme** and **typography** here.
